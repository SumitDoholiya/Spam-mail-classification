# Spam-mail-classification

A machine learning-based system for classifying emails as **Spam** or **Ham** (non-spam). This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms like **Naive Bayes** or **Logistic Regression** to accurately categorize emails based on their content.

## Features

- Preprocessing of email text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer**
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Classification of emails into Spam or Ham categories
